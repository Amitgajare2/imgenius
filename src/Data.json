    "Title": "Victorian Circus Poster Lithograph Style",
    "Name": "@Artedeingenio",
    "prompt": "Transform this image into a Victorian circus poster lithograph. Use bold flat colors (red, yellow, blue, green) with thick black outlines and dramatic shading. Pose characters in exaggerated theatrical stances, as if mid-performance. Surround them with decorative banners, ornate lettering, and vintage circus motifs: stars, rays, scrolls. Emulate aged paper texture with visible wear, creases, and ink imperfections. Typography should resemble 19th-century playbill styles. The overall look should evoke the spectacle and nostalgia of a classic carnival poster."

    "prompt": "Create a custom typographic illustration of the word [SUPER] in a vibrant, high-gloss script style that mimics glossy, liquified gel lettering. The letters should appear fluid and melting, with iridescent color transitions of teal, cyan, violet, and magenta. Add glowing highlights, star-like sparkles, and reflective light effects to enhance the chrome-like appearance. The text should have a dripping, gooey bottom edge as if the liquid is oozing down. No additional text or elements. Focus on stylized, fluid motion and a futuristic, glossy finish. Black background. Square aspect ratio."

Use bold black outlines, flat cel shading with exaggerated muscles or features, and a vivid, saturated color palette. Shadows should be blocky and simple. Characters should appear heroic, dramatic, or over-posed, with strong facial expressions and action-ready postures. The background should resemble a hand-painted matte painting, with fantastical or retro-futuristic scenery. Add light film grain or aging to match the era’s animation look."
