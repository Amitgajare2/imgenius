Here’s a complete project setup for deploying your **Single Page Application (SPA)** to multiple platforms with proper routing. I’ll include:

1. ✅ Aligned config files for:

   * `netlify.toml`
   * `firebase.json`
   * `vercel.json`
   * `public/_redirects` (for Render)
   * GitHub Pages (instructions)
2. ✅ A ready-to-use `README.md` with deployment instructions.

---

### ✅ `netlify.toml`

```toml
[[redirects]]
from = "/*"
to = "/index.html"
status = 200
```

---

### ✅ `firebase.json`

```json
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "build",
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

---

### ✅ `vercel.json`

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### ✅ `public/_redirects` (for Render)

```
/* /index.html 200
```

> This file should go inside your `public` folder.

---

### ✅ GitHub Pages Instructions

1. Use `HashRouter` in React:

   ```jsx
   import { HashRouter } from 'react-router-dom';

   const App = () => (
     <HashRouter>
       {/* your routes here */}
     </HashRouter>
   );
   ```

2. Or duplicate `index.html` as `404.html`:

   ```bash
   cp build/index.html build/404.html
   ```
